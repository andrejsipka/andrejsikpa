            I have more than 2 years of experience working with frontend technologies. These days I seek for more knowledge in backend technologies to improve my skill set. However, frontend is my primary focus. For the past 2 years I have been working with <span style="font-weight: bold;">TypeScript, Angular, RxJs</span> on on daily basis. To become better, I work on my personal projects and read. Anyway check my <a class="link link--large">Resume</a> or <a class="link link--large">LinkedIn</a>.
